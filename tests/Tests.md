# Tests - How to

Test directory parts:
- Languages
- Test Files

## Languages
Languages should describe in general their characteristics for test purposes according to `general_defaults.yaml`.
`general_defaults.yaml` should contain the structure of all possible configurations with their defaults.

## Test Files
Test file should check one of:
- Program Functionality
- Language Feature

If a new language configuration is created with several features, that language should be added to 
all tests that test those features.
