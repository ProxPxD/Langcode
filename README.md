# Langcode

**Langcode** allows to define a language with its morphological and phonological rules and generate the representation 
of the language in a user-defined template. The language definition facilitates the user keeping track of the creation 
and prevents the need to apply a change in every morpheme derived from the changed morpheme by automatically adjusting 
the derived morphemes.
